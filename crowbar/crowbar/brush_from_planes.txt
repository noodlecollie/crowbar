Potential algorithm for creating a brush from planes:
- Each plane will potentially form a side of the brush, and so will need to be converted into vertices.
- For each plane, "clip" it by all other planes. This means, for the chosen plane and each other plane, generate a line equation
    representing the intersection (if this occurred).
- Next, generate a set of all intersections of these lines. This will include the vertices of the resulting polygon,
    plus some other irrelevant intersections.
- For each intersection point, check it against all other planes. If it is in front of any, discard it.
- What's left in the set will be the vertices of the brush. Order them so that the traversal order will result in the normal being
    in the same direction as the plane that was clipped in the first place.
