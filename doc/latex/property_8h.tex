D\-E\-P\-R\-E\-C\-A\-T\-E\-D\-: Use Q\-Variant() instead.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
D\-E\-P\-R\-E\-C\-A\-T\-E\-D\-: Use Q\-Variant() instead. Defines more specific typed properties that inherit from Base\-Property. \par
 The property classes hold a key and a value -\/ these are underlyingly represented as strings and Base\-Property subclasses deal with binding these solidly to interfaces for a specific type. A property's key should endeavour to be unique (it is not defined which property will be selected if two properties have the same key). \par
 \par
 A technical note\-: due to the Qt limitation that only one inheritance of the Q\-Object class is allowed for any derived class (slots requiring an interface inherit from Q\-Object), slots on property classes are exposed through a wrapper returned by calling slots\-For() on the property. Connecting a signal to a slot on this wrapper will call the relevant non-\/slot function on the property class.
