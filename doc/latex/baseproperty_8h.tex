Defines the property base class and interfaces.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Defines the property base class and interfaces. The property classes hold a key and a value -\/ these are underlyingly represented as strings and Base\-Property subclasses (defined in \hyperlink{property_8h}{property.\-h}) deal with binding these solidly to interfaces for a specific type. A property's key should endeavour to be unique (it is not defined which property will be selected if two properties have the same key). \par
 \par
 A technical note\-: due to the Qt limitation that only one inheritance of the Q\-Object class is allowed for any derived class (slots requiring an interface inherit from Q\-Object), slots on Base\-Property classes are exposed through a wrapper returned by Base\-Property\-::slots\-Base(). Connecting a signal to a slot on this wrapper will call the relevant non-\/slot function on the Base\-Property class.
