Crowbar
=======

An open-source level editor for Source games, built using Qt5 and Qt3D.

This Branch
===========

Right now this branch holds the components I'm anticipating using. After completing my university final year project,
which should be a rough-around-the-edges demo of something editor-like, I'll be using what's here in combination with
the new version 2.0 of the Qt3D library to form a better structured, more extensible Crowbar editor.

A lot of what I've learned with regard to the design of the application, how the model-view-controller paradigm works
and how to draw things in 3D will inform the creation of what's on this branch.
